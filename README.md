Step 1: Data Exploration with Pandas

Load the Dataset
 
General Information:
 
Display the dataset's structure, including column names, data types, and memory usage.
Identify the number of missing values or zeros in the dataset.
 
Descriptive Analysis:

 
Use the describe() function to analyze:
 
Summary statistics for each column (mean, min, max, quartiles).
Look for irregularities, such as columns with unrealistic minimum or maximum values.
 
Step 2: Data Exploration with ydata-profiling

Generate a Profiling Report:
 
Use ydata-profiling to create an interactive report that includes:
 
Column descriptions (type, unique values, missing values).
Distributions for numerical columns.
Correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
Highlighted outliers or anomalies.
 
Analyze the Report:
 
Identify missing values in key columns such as Glucose, Insulin, and BMI.
Examine correlations between columns like Age, Glucose, and Outcome.
Note any interesting insights or patterns (e.g., higher glucose levels correlated with diabetes diagnosis).

Step 3: Summary

Document Findings:
 
Write a summary of key observations from both Pandas and the ydata-profiling report.
Mention:
 
Patterns or trends in glucose, BMI, or pregnancies.
Any notable correlations between variables.
Issues such as missing or zero values in critical columns.
 
Suggestions:
 
Recommend next steps, such as handling missing values, addressing outliers, or e* Column descriptions(type, unique values, missing values).
